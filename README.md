# Cardio
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term describing conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. CVD includes disorders such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and hypertension.

Biological and Clinical Aspects
Pathophysiology:
CVD primarily results from atherosclerosis â€” a process involving the build-up of plaques (cholesterol, fat, cellular debris) inside artery walls. This narrows arteries, reducing blood flow and leading to ischemia (oxygen deprivation). Over time, plaques may rupture causing thrombosis (clotting) and acute events like heart attacks or strokes.

Risk Factors:

Modifiable: High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, stress

Non-modifiable: Age, sex (males higher risk), family history, genetics

Symptoms:
Chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, swelling in legs

Diagnostic Tests:

Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)

Echocardiogram

Stress test

Cardiac catheterization and angiography

Blood tests (cholesterol, cardiac enzymes like troponin)

Treatment:

Lifestyle modifications: diet, exercise, quitting smoking

Medications: antihypertensives, statins, antiplatelets, anticoagulants

Surgical interventions: angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery

Technical Aspects for AI/ML Models in CVD Detection
Data Types Used:

Clinical records (demographics, symptoms, history)

Imaging data (echocardiograms, angiograms)

Time-series data (ECG signals)

Laboratory results (blood tests)

Commonly Used Features:

Vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure

Lab values: LDL/HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose levels

ECG parameters: heart rate variability, ST-segment changes

Patient demographics and lifestyle info

Machine Learning Techniques:

Classification algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression

Deep learning: CNNs for image interpretation, RNNs/LSTMs for ECG time-series analysis

Feature engineering: extraction of key clinical markers, dimensionality reduction

Explainability: SHAP, LIME to understand model predictions in clinical context

Challenges:

Data heterogeneity and quality variability

Imbalanced datasets due to rarity of some conditions

Need for large annotated datasets for deep learning

Ensuring model interpretability and clinical trust

Importance in Healthcare
Early and accurate CVD detection can dramatically reduce mortality

AI-powered tools assist clinicians by integrating multifaceted data for risk stratification

Personalized treatment planning based on patient-specific predictive models

Continuous monitoring (e.g., wearable ECGs) enables proactive care and timely interventions
